#  Unity Slot Game

##  Game Overview
A slot machine game where the reels spin when you pull the lever and stop after a random delay, generating winnings based on symbol alignment.

##  WebGL Build Instructions
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to `/Build/WebGL`.
3. Open `index.html` in a browser (or use a local server).

##  Bonus Features
- Adjustable bet amount.

##  Thought Process
I focused on creating a realistic slot machine flow:
1. Designed core reel spin logic.
2. Added lever interaction to trigger the spin.
3. Integrated betting system for gameplay depth.
4. Organized assets into Unityâ€™s standard folder structure for clarity.
